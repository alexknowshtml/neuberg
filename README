Original app was created from Kevin Fitzpatrick's fork of eLabs' rails template ( http://github.com/kfitzpatrick/rails-1-2-3-launcher ).

The Clearance authentication code was removed since there were bugs and Kevin wasn't comfortable with the auth/auth code existing before the features did.

Chris is now working on the project, too.
